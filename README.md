# Introductory Computer Science Final Project Progression (version of final exam and combined)
- See Introductory Computer Science for Lessons and Sequence of Projects

#### Common Outcomes
- Full Screen & Design Ratios
- Quit Button
- Side Loading to Android

#### Drawing Program - focus on mouse or touch screen interactions through lessons
- Review of entire course through a single project
- Note: students are able to suggest their own case study addressing following expectations

Purpose
- Learning Structural Modularity
- Introduction to Tabs in Processing-JAVA (to Introduce Procedural Programming)

Expectations
- 2D Shapes
- Images
- Interactivity like color changing effects
- Text
- Mouse Interactions like drawing
- Feature list that utilizes coding to mimic Paint.net, MS Paint, etc.

#### Music Program - focus on keyboard interactions and generalize to mouse or touch screen interactions

Purpose: Introduction to Adding Libraries through Processing-JAVA IDE and the code
- Adding music and sound effects

Expectations
- Buttons
  - Quit Button
  - Play-Pause
  - Stop
  - Forward, Reverse inside song (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Loop: once, defined number, infinite (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Next & Back Song Buttons with Introduction to Array Out of Bounds Error using IF
- Features
  - Meta Data: auto populating variables using music files
    - Able to use a IF-null catch to console-log which variables will show information

Advanced Features (Combinations of previous code)
- Auto playing: when current song finishes, automatically play the next song
- Music Organized into Folder accessed in code using pathways

---

# Intermediate Computer Science
- Using all expectations from Introductory Computer Science - manipulating visual and auditory data

#### Common Outcomes
- Full Screen & Design Ratios
- Quit Button
- Side Loading to Android

#### Weather Program - Auto Populating Variables from an API
- Review all Processing-Java from Introductory Computer Science
- Use an API (and all associated tools) to auto populate variables
- Introduce feedback based on ranges of variables that have been auto-populated
- Manipulating auto-populated variables to deliver specific information

#### Tic Tac Toe - Designing Algorithms to Play Tic Tac Toe
- Organizing increasing complexity in algorithms to facilitate workflow in programming
- Based on Google's Tic Tak Toe (2-player, easy, medium, impossible)

Purpose: introduction to Game (Situation) Simulation and evaluation of game space developing "whole game" understanding

Introduction to artificial intelligence (using high school leveled mathematics)
- Layering ways to make choices and hardcoding these choices to create levels
- Note: choices are made into procedures
- Extension: create randomly choose a percent and then use that percent to make a choice
  - "How can certain choices in game create other choices?"
  - "Why do some people with less experience in Tic Tak Toe win inconsistently? How do we program this?"

GUI Expectations
- Player keyboard (3 by 3)
- Scoreboard and record of games played (extension: fileIO with .txt)
- Reset button
- Dark Mode

Algorithm Procedures (illustration of translating game space into code)
- 2-person mode: click section, write, and alternate X & O
- Easy, medium, impossible modes: choice or hard coding of procedures below
- Recognize 3 in a row and stop the game: update scoreboard, activate reset, celebrate win
- Random Choice, response to X moves
- Recognize 2 in a row and block or complete 3 in a row
- Advanced: quit and save game state, to be restarted when game restarted

Note: order and coding of algorithmic procedures forms game rules, ethics, and morals

Advanced Applications: Super Tic Tac Toe
- See Special Project: Super Tic Tak Toe in JavaScript, hosted locally

# Advanced Computer Science
- Pong Game: review Procedural Programming Methodology and Introduce Object Orientated Programming Methodologies
- Chatbot: Using Object Orientated Programming Methodologies for manipulating String Data (parsing, sorting, and searching)
- [Optional, non Advanced Placement] Password Program: manipulating String Data as one String Literal (password or passphrase)

Note: projects extend intermediate game rules, ethics, and morals to communication

#### Pong

Purpose: using visual data to learn new and abstract programming methodology (Object Orientated Programming)
- For example: a pong ball becomes an `object` automatically tracked by the computer, and might be instantiated infinitely

#### AP Labs: Chatbot
- Enrichment for Chatbot: Learning Responses based on past responses

Purpose: using String Literals in Arrays and Lists (extension from visual data)

Optional Projects
- Password Program

#### Password Program
