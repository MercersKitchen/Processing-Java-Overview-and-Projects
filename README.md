# Introductory Computer Science Final Project Progression (version of final exam and combined)
- See Introductory Computer Science for Lessons and Sequence of Projects

#### Common Outcomes
- Full Screen & Design Ratios
- Quit Button
- Side Loading to Android

#### Drawing Program - focus on mouse or touch screen interactions through lessons
- Review of entire course through a single project
- Note: students are able to suggest their own case study addressing following expectations

Purpose
- Learning Structural Modularity
- Introduction to Tabs in Processing-JAVA (to Introduce Procedural Programming)

Expectations
- 2D Shapes
- Images
- Interactivity like color changing effects
- Text
- Mouse Interactions like drawing
- Feature list that utilizes coding to mimic Paint.net, MS Paint, etc.

#### Music Program - focus on keyboard interactions and generalize to mouse or touch screen interactions

Purpose: Introduction to Adding Libraries through Processing-JAVA IDE and the code
- Adding music and sound effects

Expectations
- Buttons
  - Quit Button
  - Play-Pause
  - Stop
  - Forward, Reverse inside song (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Loop: once, defined number, infinite (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Next & Back Song Buttons with Introduction to Array Out of Bounds Error using IF
- Features
  - Meta Data: auto populating variables using music files
    - Able to use a IF-null catch to console-log which variables will show information

Advanced Features (Combinations of previous code)
- Auto playing: when current song finishes, automatically play the next song
- Music Organized into Folder accessed in code using pathways

# Intermediate Computer Science
- Using all expectations from Introductory Computer Science - manipulating visual and auditory data

#### Common Outcomes
- Full Screen & Design Ratios
- Quit Button
- Side Loading to Android

#### Weather Program - Auto Populating Variables from an API
- Review all Processing-Java, Introductory Computer Science
- Use an API )(and all associated tools) to auto populate variables
- Introduce feedback based on ranges of variables

#### Tic Tac Toe - Designing Algorithms to Play Tic Tac Toe
- Organizing increasing complexity in algorithms to facilitate workflow in programming
- Based on Google's Tic Tak Toe (2-player, easy, medium, impossible)

Introduction to AI
- Layering ways to make choices and hardcoding these choices to create levels
- Note: choices are made into procedures
- Extension: create randomly choose a percent and then use that percent to make a choice
  - "How can certain choices in game create other choices?"
  - "Why do some people with less experience in Tic Tak Toe win inconsistently? How do we program this?"

Exemplar Tic Tak Toe with Percentage Choices: https://github.com/QEHS-SpecialProjects/Tic-Tak-Toe-Dawson

Advanced Applications: Super Tic Tac Toe
- See Special Project: Super Tic Tak Toe in JavaScript, hosted locally
