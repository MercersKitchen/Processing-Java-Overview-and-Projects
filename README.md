# Introductory Computer Science Final Project Progression (version of final exam and combined)
- See Introductory Computer Science for Lessons and Sequence of Projects

#### Common Outcomes
- Full Screen & Design Ratios
- Quit Button
- Side Loading to Android

#### Drawing Program - focus on mouse or touch screen interactions through lessons
- Review of entire course through a single project
- Note: students are able to suggest their own case study addressing following expectations

Purpose
- Learning Structural Modularity
- Introduction to Tabs in Processing-JAVA (to Introduce Procedural Programming)

Expectations
- 2D Shapes
- Images
- Interactivity like color changing effects
- Text
- Mouse Interactions like drawing
- Feature list that utilizes coding to mimic Paint.net, MS Paint, etc.

#### Music Program - focus on keyboard interactions and generalize to mouse or touch screen interactions

Purpose: Introduction to Adding Libraries through Processing-JAVA IDE and the code
- Adding music and sound effects

Expectations
- Buttons
  - Quit Button
  - Play-Pause
  - Stop
  - Forward, Reverse inside song (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Loop: once, defined number, infinite (controlled by a variable and arrow keys)
  - Next & Back Song Buttons with Introduction to Array Out of Bounds Error using IF
- Features
  - Meta Data: auto populating variables using music files
    - Able to use a IF-null catch to console-log which variables will show information

Advanced Features (Combinations of previous code)
- Auto playing: when current song finishes, automatically play the next song
- Music Organized into Folder accessed in code using pathways
